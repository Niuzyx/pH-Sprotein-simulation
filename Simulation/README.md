This repository contains the output PDB files of the spike protein. The initial structure of the S-protein is from the protein data bank (6VXX.pdb). The missing loops in the 6VXX structure are added by Robetta. All the PDB files are averaged from the latest 200 ns (300 ns - 500 ns) in the MD simulation.
